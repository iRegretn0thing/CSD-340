        <h1>Module 2.2 Gabriel's example</h1>

        <h2> Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>

        <p class="intro">Hello! My full name is Gabriel Pedraza Torres, but I mainly go by Gabe.</br>
        I currently live in Orlando Florida, where I have been living since July of 2021.</br>
        My current career is in entertainment technology, or technical theatre, as it is more commonly known as.</p>
        
        <p class="sentence"><span>I work full time as an entertainment technician at the Star Wars Galactic Starcruiser for the Walt Disney World company.</br>
        This involves navigating show control systems, audio, lighting, and props, for the perfomances throughout the "ship".</br>
        Before Disney, I did similar work for the SeaWorld themepark.</p>
        
        <p>Before doing this type of work in Florida, I lived in Denver, Colorado, where I pursued a BFA in Applied Theatre Technology and Design.</br>
        During this time, I freelanced with lighting work accross the local theatre and live entertainment industry as I progressed through my studies.</br>
        While I do enjoy working in this industry, it does have its problems in both practices and in compensation, and I am looking towards greener pastures.</p>
        
        <p> I was born in Florida, but was raised shortly after in Puerto Rico, where I lived for about 9 years. I then moved to Denver, Colorado, where I lived for 15 years.</br>
         While Florida has been an alright stay, I do hope to change careers or make a transition to another job once this degree is complete, in order to move back to CO.</br>
        I am not sure yet what specific role I wish to work with, but a remote position would match perfectly with what my current goals are, in the tech industry or otherwise.</span></p>
